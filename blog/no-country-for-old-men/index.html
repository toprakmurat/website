    <h2 style="text-align: center;">No Country for Old Men</h2>
  
  <p>I read people's comments on Coen brothers' No Country for Old Men movie and most people say that they felt oddness and something that feels different from other movies. My first impression of seeing the movie was "waow it is such a different movie" just like everybody else, indeed. This movie is an adaptation of Corman McCarthy's book with the same name.</p>
<p>But why is it distinguishable among other movies? I think the answer is the infamous character Anton Chigurh. This character is strong-willed and cold-blooded, has some principles but has no past, no family, no relatives, nobody that he cares and showing no emotions. His haircut is weird, he seems he is from nowhere by his look. In brief, this character does not reflect any weaknesses, he is just a real psychopath. We cannot sympathize with Anton unlike other known psychopaths such as Patrick Bateman and Joker.</p>
<p>As the movie continues, it mainly focuses on Anton Chigurh chasing Llewelyn Moss. Llewelyn Moss finds many dead bodies and 2 million dollars in a satchel when he was returning home from hunting. I think he represents people trying to be rich using fast and illegal ways and because it is a well-known crime I think that he is also the symbol of criminals in the past. He steals the money but there is a tracker in the satchel as we learn later. Anton was employed to steal that money also and starts to chase Llewelyn Moss using that tracker. However, these are not related what the movie is trying to tell.</p>
<p>As we learn at the end of the movie, Anton Chigurh is not a real person, he is a denotation effort of Ed Tom -the sheriff of the town-. (That's why the movie is named No Country for Old Men.) Ed cannot understand the criminals and the crimes that are committed at his time. He thinks that he is "outmatched" as he cannot catch Anton Chirgurh nor protects his victims and finally retires from being a sheriff. He tries to understand these criminals by portraying the worst, Anton. And yes at least he succeeded in that, Anton Chigurh is considered as the best psychopath portrayal by 2 Belgian psychiatrists who watched over 400 psychopath movies. Of course, we also need to take into account Javier Bardem's performance to this character, too. I know that he was an amazing actor after watching Dune movies, but this was his best performance by far. He also won an Oscar for his performance in this movie.</p>
<p>The most memorable moment of the movie was the talk between Anton and owner of the little store at the beginning of the movie. It is the scene where we get tips about Anton's cruel personality. Owner of the store just tries to start a conversation by guessing that he is from Dallas by the plate of the car. And that's where Anton becomes really angry. His personality does not matter for him and should not matter to anybody else, he then learns that store belongs to that man's father-in-law. He gets annoyed with this information also. Then, he tosses a coin and makes the man call it. His life depends on this guess and he guesses correctly. Tossing a coin to kill a man? We can understand from here that Anton has some weird habits and principles.</p>
<p>One thing that caught my eye though is that directors almost did not use any music in the movie. The movie continues in a complete silence in some scenes and raising the tension in this way. I really wanted to see in the theaters after watching. It also does not canalize the audience to a certain way. We do not see any internal conversation of Anton. If it were a novel -for example Dostoyevski's- we would have a chance to symapthize with him and at some point we would understand why he is killing people even animals in the name of his 'principles'. I don't know if it is also the same in the book but if it's not, this is why I loved the movie and I really appreciate Coen brothers for this as reflecting it in a movie is very difficult.</p>
